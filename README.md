## Other
If you want to start the project, you will need create a bootable device and use it on a 64-bit computer, or load iso in qemu64 _(you can use script)_.

If you want to build the project or, god forbid, work with it, you will need a cross-compiler, which you can either build yourself _(https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross_Compiler)_ or take an already built one _(https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/tools/crosstool/)_.
